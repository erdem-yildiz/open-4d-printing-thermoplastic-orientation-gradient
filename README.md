# 4D Printing via Process‑Induced Anisotropy
### Open Research Workflow, FAIR Metadata, and Reproducibility Resources  
**Dataset DOI:** https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18711167

This repository documents the full open‑research workflow supporting the study:

**“4D Printing via Process‑Induced Anisotropy: Experimental Dataset (PLA, Raman, Shrinkage & Curvature)”**

Raw and processed data files are hosted on Zenodo and currently under **embargo** until the associated journal article is published.  
However, **all metadata, workflow documentation, analysis notebooks, and licensing information are openly available here**.
